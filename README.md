# Pairify

With TeamBuilder, creating pairs or small teams is a breeze! Simply enter
the names, choose how many teams you need – and you're ready to go!

Want to work with the driver-navigator principle? No problem! Just enable
the “Driver” mode, and TeamBuilder ensures every team has its own “Driver”.

## Usage

1. Enter or import the list of people to be distributed into teams.
2. Set the desired **count of teams**.
3. Decide whether you want a **driver** assigned per team.
4. Click the **”Create teams“** button.

The app will randomly organize individuals into evenly distributed teams 
and assign a driver per team if needed.
